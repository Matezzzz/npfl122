# Soft Actor Critic

The paper _Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement
Learning with a Stochastic Actor_ by Tuomas Haarnoja et al. from Jan 2018
introduces a different off-policy algorithm for continuous action space.

~~~
It was followed by a continuation paper _Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and
Applications_ in Dec 2018.

~~~
The general idea is to introduce entropy directly in the value function we want
to maximize, instead of just ad-hoc adding the entropy penalty.

---
# Soft Actor Critic Objective

Until now, our goal was to optimize
$$𝔼_π \big[G_0\big].$$

~~~
Assume the rewards are deterministic and that $μ_π$ is on-policy distribution of
a policy $π$.

In the soft actor-critic, the authors intead propose to optimize the maximum
entropy objective
$$π_* = \argmax_π 𝔼_{s, a ∼ μ_π} \big[r(s, a) + α H(π(⋅|s))\big].$$

~~~
Note that the value of $α$ is dependent on the maginute of returns and that
for a fixed policy, the entropy penalty can be “hidden” in the reward.

---
# Soft Actor Critic Objective

The authors in fact utilize slightly different objective, notably a one with
the following augmented reward
$$r_π(s, a) ≝ r(s, a) + 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(s, a)} \big[H(π(⋅|s'))\big].$$

~~~
From now on, we consider **soft value** function and **soft action-value**
function corresponding to this augmented reward.

---
# Soft Policy Evaluation

Our goal is now to derive **soft policy iteration**, an analogue of policy iteration algorithm.

~~~
We start by considering soft policy evaluation. Let a modified Bellman backup
operator $𝓣_π$ be defined as
$$𝓣_π q(s, a) ≝ r(s, a) + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(s, a)} \big[v(s')\big],$$
where
$$
v(s) = 𝔼_{a ∼ π} \big[q(s, a) - α \log π(a|s)\big].$$

~~~
This modified Bellman backup operator corresponds to the usual one for the
augmented rewards $r_π(s, a)$, and therefore the repeated application
$𝓣_π^k q$ converges to $q_π$ according to the original proof.

---
# Soft Policy Improvement

While the soft policy evaluation was a straightforward modification of the
original policy evaluation, the soft policy improvement is quite different.

~~~
Assume we have a policy $π$, its action-value function $q_π$ from the soft
policy evaluation, and we want to improve the policy. Furthermore, we should
select the improved policy from a family of parametrized distributions $Π$.

~~~
We define the improved policy $π'$ as
$$π'(⋅|s) ≝ \argmin_{π̄ ∈ Π} J_π(π̄) ≝ \argmin_{π̄ ∈ Π} D_\textrm{KL}\Bigg( π̄(⋅|s) \Bigg\| \frac{\exp(\frac{1}{α} q_π(s, ⋅))}{z_π(s)} \Bigg),$$
where $z_π(s)$ is the partition function (i.e.,  normalization factor such that
the right-hand side is a distribution), which does not depend on the new policy
and thus can be ignored.

---
# Soft Policy Improvement

We now prove that $q_{π'}(s, a) ≥ q_π(s, a)$ for any state $s$ and action $a$.

~~~
We start by noting that $J_π(π') ≤ J_π(π)$, because we can always choose $π$ as
the improved policy.
~~~
Therefore,
$$𝔼_{a∼π'} \big[\log π'(a|s) - q_π(s, a) + \textcolor{gray}{\log z_π(s)}\big] ≤
  𝔼_{a∼π} \big[\log π(a|s) - q_π(s, a) + \textcolor{gray}{\log z_π(s)}\big],$$

~~~
which results in
$$𝔼_{a∼π'} \big[q_π(s, a) - \log π'(a|s)\big] ≥ v_π(s).$$

~~~
We now finish the proof analogously to the original one:
$$\begin{aligned}
q_π(s, a) &= r(s, a) + γ𝔼_{s'}[v_π(s')] \\
          &≤ r(s, a) + γ𝔼_{s'}[𝔼_{a'∼π'} [q_π(s', a') - \log π'(a'|s')] \\
          &… \\
          &≤ q_{π'}(s, a).
\end{aligned}$$

---
# Soft Policy Iteration

The soft policy iteration algorithm alternates between the soft policy
evaluation and soft policy improvement steps.

~~~
The repeated application of these two steps produce better and better policies.
If it converges to some $π_*$, we can show that it is the optimal policy
fulfilling $q_{π_*}(s, a) ≥ q_π(s, a)$.

~~~
This follows from the fact that at convergence, $J_{π_*}(π_*) ≤ J_{π_*}(π)$,
and then following the same reasoning as in the proof of the soft policy
improvement we get that $q_{π_*}(s, a) ≥ q_π(s, a)$.

---
# Soft Actor Critic

Our soft actor critic will be an off-policy algorithm with continuous action
space. The model consist of two critics $q_{→θ_1}$ and $q_{→θ_2}$, two target
critics $q_{→θ̄_1}$ and $q_{→θ̄_2}$ and finally a single actor $π_{→φ}$.

~~~
The authors state that
- with a single critic, all the described experiments still converge;
~~~
- they adopted the two critics from the TD3 paper;
~~~
- using two critics “significantly speed up training”.

---
# Soft Actor Critic – Critic Training

To train the actor, we use the modified Bellman backup operator, resulting in
the loss
$$J_q(→θ_i) = 𝔼_{s,a ∼ μ} \Big[\big(q_{→θ_i}(s, a) - \big(r(s, a) + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(s, a)} [v_\textrm{min}(s')]\big)\big)^2\Big],$$

~~~
where
$$v_\textrm{min}(s) = 𝔼_{a ∼ π_{→φ}} \Big[\min_i\big(q_{→θ_i}(s, a) \big) - α \log π_{→φ}(a | s)\Big].$$

~~~
The target critics are updates using exponentiation moving averages with
momentum $τ$.

---
# Soft Actor Critic – Actor Training

The actor is updated by directly minimizing the KL divergence, resulting in the
loss
$$J_π(→φ) = 𝔼_{s ∼ μ} 𝔼_{a ∼ π_{→φ}}\Big[α \log\big(π_{→φ}(a, s)\big) - \min_i\big(q_{→θ_i}(s, a)\big)\Big].$$

~~~
Given that our critics are differentiable, we now reparametrize the policy as
$$a = f_{→φ}(s, ε).$$

~~~
Specifically, we sample $ε ∼ 𝓝(0, 1)$ and let $f_{→φ}$ produce an unbounded
Gaussian distribution (a diagonal one if the actions are vectors).

~~~
Together, we obtain
$$J_π(→φ) = 𝔼_{s ∼ μ} 𝔼_{ε ∼ 𝓝(0, 1)}\Big[α \log\big(π_{→φ}(f_{→φ}(s, ε), s)\big) - \min_i\big(q_{→θ_i}(s, f_{→φ}(s, ε))\big)\Big].$$

---
# Soft Actor Critic – Bounding Actions

In practice, the actions need to be bounded.

~~~
The authors propose to apply an invertible squashing function $\tanh$
on the unbounded Gaussian distribution.

~~~
Consider that our policy produces an unbounded action $π(u | s)$.
To define a distribution $π̄(a | s)$ with $a = \tanh(u)$, we need to employ
the change of variables, resulting in
$$π̄(a | s) = π(u | s) \bigg(\frac{∂a}{∂u}\bigg)^{-1} = π(u | s) \bigg(\frac{∂\tanh(u)}{∂u}\bigg)^{-1}.$$

~~~
Therefore, the log-likelihood has quite a simple form
$$\log π̄(a | s) = \log π(u | s) - \log\big(1 - \tanh^2(u)\big).$$

---
# Soft Actor Critic – Automatic Entropy Adjustment

One of the most important hyperparameters is the entropy penalty $α$.

~~~
In the second paper, the authors presented an algorithm for automatic adjustment
of its value.

~~~
Instead of setting the entropy penalty $α$, they propose to specify target
entropy value $𝓗$ and then solve a constrained optimization problem
$$π_* = \argmax_π 𝔼_{s, a ∼ μ_π} \big[r(s, a)\big]\textrm{~~such that~~}𝔼_{s, a ∼ μ_π}\big[-\log π(a | s)\big] ≥ 𝓗.$$

~~~
We can then form a Lagrangian with a multiplier $α$
$$𝔼_{s, a ∼ μ_π} \Big[r(s, a) + α\big(-\log π(a | s) - 𝓗\big)\Big],$$
which should be maximized with respect to $π$ and minimized with respect
to $α ≥ 0$.

---
# Soft Actor Critic – Automatic Entropy Adjustment

To optimize the Lagrangian, we perform the _dual gradient descent_, where we
alternate between maximization with respect to $π$ and minimization with respect
to $α$.

~~~
While such a procedure is guaranteed to converge only under the convexity
assumptions, the authors report that the dual gradient descent works in practice
also with non-linear function approximation.

~~~
To conclude, the automatic entropy adjustment is performed by introducing
a final loss
$$J(α) = 𝔼_{a ∼ π} \big[-α \log π(a | s) - α 𝓗\big].$$

section: ControlVariates
# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

Let $G_{t:t+n}$ be the estimated $n$-step return
$$G_{t:t+n} ≝ \left(∑_{k=t}^{t+n-1} γ^{k-t} R_{k+1}\right) + \Big[\textrm{episode still running in }t+n\Big] γ^n V(S_{t+n}),$$

~~~
which can be written recursively as
$$G_{t:t+n} \begin{cases}
  0 & \mathrm{if~episode~ended~before~}t, \\
  V(S_t) & \mathrm{if~}n=0, \\
  R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n} & \mathrm{otherwise}.
\end{cases}$$

---
# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

Note that we can write
$$\begin{aligned}
G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t)
  &= R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n} - V(S_t) \\
  &= R_{t+1} + γ \big(G_{t+1:t+n} - V(S_{t+1})\big) + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t),
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
which yields
$$G_{t:t+n} - V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + γ\big(G_{t+1:t+n} - V(S_{t+1})\big).$$

~~~
Denoting the TD error as $δ_t ≝ R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)$, we can
therefore write the $n$-step estimated return as a sum of TD errors:
$$G_{t:t+n} = V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i δ_{t+i}.$$

---
# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

Now consider applying the IS off-policy correction to $G_{t:t+n}$ using the
importance sampling ratio
$$ρ_t ≝ \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)},~~~ρ_{t:t+n} ≝ ∏_{i=0}^n ρ_{t+i}.$$

~~~
First note that
$$𝔼_{A_t ∼ b} \big[ρ_t\big] = ∑_{A_t} b(A_t | S_t) \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)} = 1,$$

~~~
which can be extended to
$$𝔼_b \big[ρ_{t:t+n}\big] = 1.$$

---
# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

Until now, we used
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{IS} ≝ ρ_{t:t+n-1} G_{t:t+n}.$$

~~~
However, such correction has unnecessary variance. Notably, when expanding
$G_{t:t+n}$
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{IS} = ρ_{t:t+n-1} \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}\big),$$

~~~
the $R_{t+1}$ depends only on $ρ_t$, not on $ρ_{t+1:t+n}$, and given that
the expectation of the importance sampling ratio is 1, we can simplify to
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{IS} = ρ_t R_{t+1} + ρ_{t:t+n-1} γ G_{t+1:t+n}.$$

~~~
Such an estimate can be written recursively as
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{IS} = ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{IS}\big).$$

---
# Off-policy Correction Using Control Variates

We can reduce the variance even further – when $ρ_t=0$, we might consider
returning the value of $V(S_t)$ instead of 0.

~~~
Therefore, we might add another term, the so-called **control variate**, to the
estimate
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} ≝ ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}\big) + (1 - ρ_t)V(S_t),$$
which is valid, since the expected value of $1-ρ_t$ is zero and $ρ_t$ and $S_t$
are independent.

~~~
Similarly as before, rewriting to
$$\begin{aligned}
G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} - V(S_t)
  &= ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}\big) - ρ_tV(S_t) \\
  &= ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + γ (G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} - V(S_{t+1}))\big)
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
results in
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i}.$$

---
section: EligibilityTraces
# Eligibility Traces

Eligibility traces are a mechanism of combining multiple $n$-step return
estimates for various values of $n$.

~~~
First note instead of an $n$-step return, we can use any average of $n$-step
returns for different values of $n$, for example
$\frac{2}{3}G_{t:t+2} + \frac{1}{3}G_{t:t+4}$.

---
# $λ$-return

For a given $λ ∈ [0,1]$, we define **$λ$-return** as
$$G_t^λ ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^∞ λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i}.$$

~~~
![w=75%,f=right](traces_weighting.svgz)

~~~
Alternatively, the $λ$-return can be written recursively as
$$\begin{aligned}
G_t^λ &= (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} \\
      &+ λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1}^λ).
\end{aligned}$$

---
# $λ$-return

In an episodic task with time of termination $T$, we can rewrite the $λ$-return
to
$$G_t^λ = (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{T-t-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i} + λ^{T-t-1} G_t.$$

~~~
![w=60%,h=center](traces_example.svgz)

---
# Truncated $λ$-return

We might also set a limit on the largest value of $n$, obtaining
**truncated $λ$-return**
$$G_{t:t+n}^λ ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i} + λ^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}.$$

~~~
The truncated $λ$ return can be again written recursively as

$$G_{t:t+n}^λ = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ),~~G_{t:t+1}^λ = G_{t:t+1}.$$

~~~
Similarly to before, we can express the truncated $λ$ return as a sum of TD
errors

$$\begin{aligned}
  G_{t:t+n}^λ - V(S_t)
  & = (1 - λ) \big(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1})\big) + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ) - V(S_t) \\
  & = R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) + λ γ \big(G_{t+1:t+n}^λ - V(S_{t+1})\big),
\end{aligned}$$

~~~
obtaining an analogous estimate $G_{t:t+n}^λ = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i λ^i δ_{t+i}.$

---
# Variable $λ$s

The (truncated) $λ$-return can be generalized to utilize different $λ_i$ at each
step $i$. Notably, we can generalize the recursive definition

$$G_{t:t+n}^λ = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1} + λ (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^λ)$$

~~~
to
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ_i} = (1 - λ_{t+1}) G_{t:t+1} + λ_{t+1} (R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ_i}),$$

~~~
and express this quantity again by a sum of TD errors:

$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ_i} = V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) δ_{t+i}.$$

---
# Off-policy Traces with Control Variates

Finally, we can combine the eligibility traces with off-policy estimation using
control variates:
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} ≝ (1 - λ) ∑_{i=1}^{n-1} λ^{i-1} G_{t:t+i}^\mathrm{CV} + λ^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}.$$

~~~
Recalling that
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{CV} = ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^\mathrm{CV}\big) + (1 - ρ_t)V(S_t),$$
~~~

we can rewrite $G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}}$ recursively as
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} = (1 - λ) G_{t:t+1}^\mathrm{CV} + λ \Big(ρ_t\big(R_{t+1} + γ G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}}\big) + (1-ρ_t)V(S_t)\Big),$$

~~~
which we can simplify by expanding $G_{t:t+1}^\mathrm{CV}=ρ_t(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1})) + (1-ρ_t)V(S_t)$ to
$$G_{t:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} - V(S_t) = ρ_t \big(R_{t+1} + γV(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\big) + γλρ_t \big(G_{t+1:t+n}^{λ,\mathrm{CV}} - V(S_{t+1})\big).$$

---
# Off-policy Traces with Control Variates

Consequently, analogously as before, we can write the off-policy traces estimate
with control variates as

$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i λ^i ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i},$$

~~~
and by repeating the above derivation we can extend the result also for time-variable $λ_i$, we obtain
$$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ_i,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i}.$$

section: V-trace
# V-trace

V-trace is a modified version of $n$-step return with off-policy correction,
defined in the Feb 2018 IMPALA paper as (using the notation from the paper):

$$G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} ≝ V(S_t) + ∑_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_{t+j}\right) ρ̄_{t+i} δ_{t+i},$$

~~~
where $ρ̄_t$ and $c̄_t$ are the truncated importance sampling ratios for $ρ̄ ≥ c̄$:
$$ρ̄_t ≝ \min\left(ρ̄, \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)}\right),~~~~c̄_t ≝ \min\left(c̄, \frac{π(A_t | S_t)}{b(A_t | S_t)}\right).$$

~~~
Note that if $b=π$ and assuming $c̄ ≥ 1$, $v_s$ reduces to $n$-step Bellman
target.

---
# V-trace

Note that the truncated IS weights $ρ̄_t$ and $c̄_t$ play different roles:

~~~
- The $ρ̄_t$ appears defines the fixed point of the update rule. For $ρ̄=∞$, the
  target is the value function $v_π$, if $ρ̄<∞$, the fixed point is somewhere
  between $v_π$ and $v_b$. Notice that we do not compute a product of these
  $ρ̄_t$ coefficients.

~~~
  Concretely, the fixed point of an operator defined by $G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace}$
  corresponds to a value function of the policy
  $$π_ρ̄(a|s) ∝ \min\big(ρ̄b(a|s), π(a|s)\big).$$

~~~
- The $c̄_t$ impacts the speed of convergence (the contraction rate of the
  Bellman operator), not the sought policy. Because a product of the $c̄_t$
  ratios is computed, it plays an important role in variance reduction.

~~~
However, the paper utilizes $c̄=1$ and out of $ρ̄ ∈ \{1, 10, 100\}$, $ρ̄=1$ works
empirically the best, so the distinction between $c̄_t$ and $ρ̄_t$ is not useful in
practice.

---
# V-trace Analysis

Let us define the (untruncated for simplicity; similar results can be proven for
a truncated one) V-trace operator $𝓡$ as:
$$𝓡 V(S_t) ≝ V(S_t) + 𝔼_b \left[∑_{i ≥ 0} γ^i \left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_{t+j}\right) ρ̄_{t+i} δ_{t+i}\right],$$
where the expectation $𝔼_b$ is with respect to trajectories generated by behaviour policy $b$.
~~~
Assume there exists $β ∈ (0, 1]$ such that $𝔼_b ρ̄_0 ≥ β$.
~~~

It can be proven (see Theorem 1 in Appendix A.1 in the Impala paper if interested) that
such an operator is a contraction with a contraction constant
$$γ^{-1} - \big(1 - γ\big) ∑_{i ≥ 0} γ^i 𝔼_b \left[\left(∏\nolimits_{j=0}^{i-1} c̄_j\right) ρ̄_i \right] ≤ 1-(1-γ)β<1,$$
therefore, $𝓡$ has a unique fixed point.

# V-trace Analysis

We now prove that the fixed point of $𝓡$ is $V^{π_ρ̄}$. We have:
$$\begin{aligned}
  & 𝔼_b \Big[ ρ̄_t\big(R_{t+1} + γ V^{π_ρ̄}(S_{t+1}) - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\big)\big| S_t\Big] \\
  &= ∑_a b(a|S_t) \min\left(\bar \rho, \frac{π(a|S_t)}{b(a|S_t)} \right) \Big[R_{t+1} + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(S_t, a)} V^{π_ρ̄}(s') - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\Big] \\
  &= \underbrace{∑_a π_ρ̄(a|S_t) \Big[R_{t+1} + γ 𝔼_{s' ∼ p(S_t, a)} V^{π_ρ̄}(s') - V^{π_ρ̄}(S_t)\Big]}_{=0} ∑_b \min\big(ρ̄ b(b|S_t), π(b|S_t) \big), \\
\end{aligned}$$
where the tagged part is zero, since it is the Bellman equation for $V^{π_ρ̄}$.
~~~
This shows that $𝓡 V^{π_ρ̄} = V^{π_ρ̄}$, and therefore $V^{π_ρ̄}$ is the unique fixed point of $𝓡$.

~~~
Consequently, in
$G_{t:t+n}^\mathrm{λ_i,CV} = V(S_t) + ∑\nolimits_{i=0}^{n-1} γ^i \left(\scriptstyle ∏_{j=1}^i λ_{t+j}\right) ρ_{t:t+i} δ_{t+i},$
only the last $ρ_{t+i}$ from every $ρ_{t:t+i}$ is actually needed for off-policy
correction; $ρ_{t:t+i-1}$ can be considered as traces.

# IMPALA

Impala (**Imp**ortance Weighted **A**ctor-**L**earner **A**rchitecture) was
suggested in Feb 2018 paper and allows massively distributed implementation
of an actor-critic-like learning algorithm.

~~~
Compared to A3C-based agents, which communicate gradients with respect to the
parameters of the policy, IMPALA actors communicate trajectories to the
centralized learner.

~~~
If many actors are used, the policy used to generate a trajectory can lag behind
the latest policy. Therefore, the V-trace off-policy actor-critic
algorithm is employed.

# IMPALA

Consider a parametrized functions computing $v(s; →θ)$ and $π(a|s; →ω)$,
we update the critic in the direction of
$$\Big(G_{t:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} - v(S_t; →θ)\Big) ∇_{→θ} v(S_t; →θ),$$

~~~
and the actor in the direction of the policy gradient
$$ρ̄_t ∇_{→ω} \log π(A_t | S_t; →ω)\big(R_{t+1} + γG_{t+1:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace} - v(S_t; →θ)\big),$$
where we estimated $Q^π(S_t, A_t)$ as $R_{t+1} + γG_{t+1:t+n}^\textrm{V-trace}$.

~~~
Finally, we again add the entropy regularization term $β H\big(π(⋅ | S_t; →ω)\big)$ to the
loss function.

# IMPALA – Population Based Training

For Atari experiments, population based training with a population of 24 agents
is used to adapt entropy regularization, learning rate, RMSProp $ε$ and the
global gradient norm clipping threshold.

# IMPALA – Population Based Training

For Atari experiments, population based training with a population of 24 agents
is used to adapt entropy regularization, learning rate, RMSProp $ε$ and the
global gradient norm clipping threshold.

In population based training, several agents are trained in parallel. When an
agent is _ready_ (after 5000 episodes), then:
~~~
- it may be overwritten by parameters and hyperparameters of another randomly
  chosen agent, if it is sufficiently better (5000 episode mean capped human
  normalized score returns are 5% better);
~~~
- and independently, the hyperparameters may undergo a change (multiplied by
  either 1.2 or 1/1.2 with 33% chance).

- **No-correction**: no off-policy correction;
- **$ε$-correction**: add a small value $ε=10^{-6}$
  during gradient calculation to prevent $π$ to be
  very small and lead to unstabilities during $\log π$
  computation;
- **1-step**: no off-policy correction in update of the value function,
  TD errors are multiplied by the corresponding $ρ$ but no $c$s;
  it can be considered V-trace “without traces”.
