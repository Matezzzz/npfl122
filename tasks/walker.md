### Assignment: walker
#### Date: Deadline: Dec 05, 23:59
#### Points: 5 points

In this exercise exploring continuous robot control,
try solving the [BipedalWalker-v3 environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/BipedalWalker-v2)
environment from the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).
The environment is continuous, states and actions are described at
[OpenAI Gym Wiki](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/BipedalWalker-v2).

In ReCodEx, you are expected to submit an already trained model,
which is evaluated with two seeds, each for 100 episodes with a time
limit of 10 minutes. If your average return is at least 100, you obtain
5 points.

The template with the SAC agent will be available, but you can also solve the
assignment with DDPG/TD3.
