### TOCEntry: Install

- _Installing to central user packages repository_

  You can install all required packages to central user packages repository using
 `pip3 install --user tensorflow==2.6.2 tensorflow_probability==0.14.1 numpy==1.19.5 gym==0.20.0 pyglet==1.5.21 ufal.pybox2d==2.3.10`.

- _Installing to a virtual environment_

  Python supports virtual environments, which are directories containing
  independent sets of installed packages. You can create a virtual environment
  by running `python3 -m venv VENV_DIR` followed by
  `VENV_DIR/bin/pip3 install tensorflow==2.6.2 tensorflow_probability==0.14.1 numpy==1.19.5 gym==0.20.0 pyglet==1.5.21 ufal.pybox2d==2.3.10`.

### TOCEntry: ReCodEx

- _What files can be submitted to ReCodEx?_

  You can submit multiple files of any type to ReCodEx. There is a limit of
  **20** files per submission, with a total size of **20MB**.

- _What file does ReCodEx execute and what arguments does it use?_

  Exactly one file with `py` suffix must contain a line starting with `def main(`.
  Such a file is imported by ReCodEx and the `main` method is executed
  (during the import, `__name__ == "__recodex__"`).

  The file must also export an argument parser called `parser`. ReCodEx uses its
  arguments and default values, but it overwrites some of the arguments
  depending on the test being executed â€“ the template should always indicate which
  arguments are set by ReCodEx and which are left intact.

- _What are the time and memory limits?_

  The memory limit during evaluation is **1.5GB**. The time limit varies, but it should
  be at least 10 seconds and at least twice the running time of my solution.

- _Do agents need to be trained directly in ReCodEx?_

  No, you can pre-train your agent locally (unless specified otherwise in the task
  description).
